📌 Neoplasms Classification

This project is part of my Undergraduate Thesis (TCC) in Information Systems at UNESP. The goal is to classify skin neoplasms as benign or malignant using Machine Learning techniques. The model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to improve classification accuracy.

🔍 Features:
✔️ Preprocessing and augmentation of medical images
✔️ Model training with PyTorch and CUDA acceleration
✔️ Evaluation with validation accuracy and loss tracking
✔️ Early stopping to prevent overfitting

📂 Dataset:
The dataset contains labeled skin lesion images and is split into training and testing sets.

🚀 How to Use:
1️⃣ Clone the repository
2️⃣ Install dependencies (requirements.txt)
3️⃣ Train the model using the provided Jupyter Notebook
4️⃣ Evaluate and test predictions
